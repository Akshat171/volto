# Frontend

Volto is the React-based frontend for the [Plone CMS](https://plone.org). It is
the default UI for the Plone 6 release.

Volto provides integration with the modern frontend development world, access to the
huge ecosystem of React libraries and addons and not least, open Plone as a development
platform for non-Plone trained programmers.

Thanks to the use of the Plone API framework, it is fully compatible with
Plone's content type framework. But its power comes from the innovative Pastanaga Editor,
which replaces the typical richtext editing experience provided by the
TinyMCE editor with a streamlined Mosaic-like editor based on "blocks".

Thanks to their simplicity and easy access to advanced frontend integration,
the Volto blocks can provide a fast development experience that reduces
developer frustration and improves end-user experience.

To start developing a new Volto project you should have minimal React and
modern Javascript knowledge. Follow the
[Getting started](./getting-started/install) guide to bootstrap a new Volto
project and start hacking!
